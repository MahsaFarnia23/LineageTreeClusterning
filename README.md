# New generalized metric to compare B-cell lineage trees
The B-cell lineage tree delineates sequential stages of B-cell differentiation and maturation, evolving from hematopoietic stem cells into fully functional antibody-producing cells within the immune system. The B-cell lineage tree can be modeled by a type of evolutionary tree. However, it is impossible to compare this lineage tree without a robust metric. This comparison of B-cell lineage trees offers the opportunity to examine variations in a lineage of patient over time in a clinical context, and to compare lineages from different patients suffering from the same disease. Thus, the problem of comparing multiple B-cell lineage trees becomes relevant. In this paper, we present a new efficient cutting-edge metric for comparing B-cell lineage trees with a mathematical foundation. The efficiency of the new metric was assessed using both synthetic and real data.
