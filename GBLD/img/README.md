# Images of the Project 🌄

This folder contains images related to the **GBLD** project. There are **4 images** in **SVG format** used in the project. 

### Files Included:

1. **image1.svg** –  [Visual representation of a B cell lineage tree ]🌳
2. **image2.svg** –  [A graphical representation of the GBLD metric approach ]
3. **image3.svg** –  [The topological structure of the simulated dataset ]
4. **image4.svg** –  [Three selected lineage trees from the simulated dataset ]

These images are used to visualize various aspects of the **Generalized Branch Length Distance (GBLD)** metric and its application to immune system lineage tree clustering.
